# Intro

Hi Data Scientists. Like you guys, my favorite part of being a data scientist is sitting at my computer waiting for models to run.


Just kidding. We switch to running other models, working on other projects, or leaving our computer for a bit. Whatever it is, we are distracted by something else for the time being.
